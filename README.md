# How to create a numpy array 
__Either by__\
__1. casting a list or tuple A to an array method arr=np.array(A)__\
__OR__\
__2. by using  one of the built in functions for a Numpy arrays such as np.array.zeros() and array.ones() arr.linspace() and eye() and__

__3. also use the random generation methods you call np.random.rand() and then np.random.randn() and or some of the other random methods  np.random.randint() to generate an array.__

__\***Useful methods and attributes for a numpy array:__\
__1. methods: reshape(), min(), max(), argmin(), argmax()__\
__2.attributes: shape, dtype, ndim, size__


# Numpy Array Indexing, slicing and selection
__1. Indexing:Array indexing is the same as accessing an array element.  A= array[1,2,3,4] A[0]= 1, A[-1]=4(negative index from the end__\ 

__You can access an array element by referring to its index number.   A =array[[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8]  A[1, 2]=A[1][2]=A[row][column]=element on 2nd row and 3rd column= 7__

__The indexes in NumPy arrays start with 0, meaning that the first element has index 0, and the second has index 1 etc.__\

__2. Slicing:__\
__3.Selection:__
